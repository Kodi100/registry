# Link Relation Registry Interface

This repository manages requests to add and change entries in the [link relation type IANA registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml). 

To register a relation type (or request a change to an existing one), you can:

* [File an issue](https://github.com/link-relations/registry/issues/new)
* [Make a pull request](https://github.com/link-relations/registry/compare)

See [RFC5988bis](https://mnot.github.io/I-D/rfc5988bis/) for more information about link relations; in particular, the [requirements for registered relation types](https://mnot.github.io/I-D/rfc5988bis/#registered).

Note that the contents of this repository are NOT the official registry; it should function as a mirror, but in the case of conflicts, the IANA registry is authoritative.
