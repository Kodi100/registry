# Link Relation Registry Interface

This repository manages requests to add and change entries in the [link relation type IANA registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/). Please note our [contribution terms](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

To request registration of a new relation type (or a change to an existing one), you can:

* [File an issue](https://github.com/link-relations/registry/issues/new),
* Send e-mail to [the link-relations mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/link-relations).

Please do not use pull requests, and make **only one request** per issue.

See [RFC8288](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288) for more information about link relations; in particular, the [requirements for registered relation types](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288#registered).

Once approved, your request will be incorporated both into this repository, and into the IANA registry, whereupon it will be officially registered.

Note that the contents of this repository are NOT the official registry; it should function as a mirror, but in the case of conflicts, the [IANA registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/) is authoritative.
